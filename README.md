# Cryptopals Challenges in Go 🧑‍💻🔐

This repository contains my solutions to the [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) implemented in **Golang**. The Cryptopals challenges are a great way to learn about cryptography by solving real-world cryptographic problems.

## 🚀 About the Project
The **Cryptopals Crypto Challenges** are a series of 48 exercises covering topics such as:
- AES Encryption and Modes (ECB, CBC, CTR)
- XOR Ciphers
- Hash Functions
- Message Authentication Codes (MAC)
- RSA and Public-Key Cryptography

This repository serves as my personal learning log and solution archive.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Go (Golang)** version 1.21 or higher
- A basic understanding of cryptography concepts (helpful but not required)
